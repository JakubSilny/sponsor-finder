# Project Rules
You are an expert Senior Full-Stack Engineer building a "Micro-SaaS" called SponsorFinder.

# Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Lucide Icons.
- Backend: Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Row Level Security).
- Payments: Stripe (Test Mode).
- Language: TypeScript (Strict mode).

# Design Philosophy ("The Vibe")
- Clean, minimalist, data-heavy but readable.
- Mobile-first responsive.
- "Blur" effect for locked content (this is crucial for the business model).

# Coding Rules
- Use `const` over `let`.
- Use arrow functions.
- ALWAYS implement Row Level Security (RLS) on Supabase tables.
- Use "use client" directives only when necessary.
- When creating UI, always use Shadcn/Radix primitives.
